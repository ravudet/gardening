## 2025 garden

#### FOLLOW UPS FROM LAST YEAR
- You tried 5 rows of carrots in the square garden bed this year; how did that turn out?
- You put basil plants in with the black beans and carrots because something (maybe ants?) seem to be eating your seeds and hopefully the basil will deter them. Also note that you put a lot of bug spray down in those beds at the end of 2024, so maybe that was what really did it?
- Get airtight containers for freezing? Youâ€™ll want them to not leave too much unused freezer space, and to be easily swappable across freezers
- In 2024 (and a previous year) the broccoli seeds didn't sprout. You're trying doubling up on seeds this year. How did that go?
- You added the tree and bush pruning before the first mow of the season. Did that work out? Do you also need to do it after the last mow of the season?
- Did the 2024 garlic do well? If not, it's probably because your curing didn't work well.
- You put copper lining around the garden beds. How did that work out? Do you really need to do that every year, or will it last from year to year?
- You did half your beds with compost and half with soil. Which did better?

#### NOTES FOR NEXT YEAR:
- i think it will make sense to do sundays next year instead of taking time off; and you will want to do "second to last sunday of march" to sift compost, "last sunday of march" to finish sifting compost" and "first sunday of april" to do the first major planting
- harvesting:
    - put on ankle brace
    - get dressed
    - bring red phone
    - Use wired headphones in the morning so that you can call people in the afternoon
    - weigh bucket
    - take pictures of the plants
    - set up camera
    - harvest
    - Take picture of crop with red phone
    - Weigh crop
- planting:
    - mark bed with dimensions
    - dig trench
    - take pictures
    - count the number of seeds in a pack while planting
    - take pictures
- do you want to automate watering?
- roof clearing in february 2024 took 05:20 if you need to record that somewhere
- you should move the march 18 "schedule vacation days" event to happen before planting basil; if you move this forward, instead of noting that spreading compost is the first day off, just note that turning compost shouldn't require taking time off
- you should remove either the 04/04+04/05 plant basil event of the 02/18 plant basil event
- you could have a small greenhouse that you use for seedlings so that they can get established and not be interfered with by pests; you don't need to give the seedlings as much room since they would grow large enough to interfere with each other; you probably don't need to do this for the first planting of the year, but subsequent ones (like broccoli) might be good
- you didn't start watering basil until you planted everything; did that work?
- do you want to plant more basil in the garlic beds?
- you planted parsley one in each of the garden beds, you should probably update the schedule to say this
- you didn't start watering parsley until you planted everything; did that work?
- when scheduling vacation days, look at on-call schedule; what you did this year was postpone and garden activities that occur during primary until the first available day after primary; you took off secondaries regardless
- when scheduling vacation days, try to use a tighter fit based on how long each activity actually takes so that you can use fewer vacation days
- the first weeding of the season took a long time; maybe it makes more sense to start sooner in the year by a few weeks?
- you noticed when you were weeding for the first time, there were a decent number of small slugs hanging out under the "brush" (leaves, pine needle, etc) and also you noticed some grasshoppers or crickets or something; it might not be 100% slugs that are eating things
- you didn't turn compost on 03/29 like you were supposed to
- in 2024, you went to prep compost and realized it wasn't "done" yet. so you let it another year. it looks great this year. but the question is, in 2024, did the process of taking all of the compost out of the bin and then putting it back in facilitate it getting "done" for 2025? you haven't turned the 2026 compost this year, so next year, if the compost is not "done", you need to turn *next year's* compost each year
- i think turning the compost for the given year probably has no effect (maybe turning next year's has effect, noted above)

This was the "station" setup that you used for the sifting:

![2025-04-01%20sifting%20station%202.JPG](./images/2025-04-01%20sifting%20station%202.JPG)

Your overall process was to sift 2 buckets of compost at a time into the tub. Then you would dump the tub into a garden bed. You spent 07:20:48 sifting on this day.

#### 04/02 sifted more compost

You spent another 05:18:16 sifting on this day.
