## 2025 garden

#### FOLLOW UPS FROM LAST YEAR
- You tried 5 rows of carrots in the square garden bed this year; how did that turn out?
- You put basil plants in with the black beans and carrots because something (maybe ants?) seem to be eating your seeds and hopefully the basil will deter them. Also note that you put a lot of bug spray down in those beds at the end of 2024, so maybe that was what really did it?
- Get airtight containers for freezing? Youâ€™ll want them to not leave too much unused freezer space, and to be easily swappable across freezers
- In 2024 (and a previous year) the broccoli seeds didn't sprout. You're trying doubling up on seeds this year. How did that go?
- You added the tree and bush pruning before the first mow of the season. Did that work out? Do you also need to do it after the last mow of the season?
- Did the 2024 garlic do well? If not, it's probably because your curing didn't work well.
- You put copper lining around the garden beds. How did that work out? Do you really need to do that every year, or will it last from year to year?
- You did half your beds with compost and half with soil. Which did better?

#### NOTES FOR NEXT YEAR:
- harvesting:
    - put on ankle brace
    - get dressed
    - bring red phone
    - Use wired headphones in the morning so that you can call people in the afternoon
    - weigh bucket
    - take pictures of the plants
    - set up camera
    - harvest
    - Take picture of crop with red phone
    - Weigh crop
- planting:
    - mark bed with dimensions
    - dig trench
    - take pictures
    - count the number of seeds in a pack while planting
    - take pictures
- do you want to automate watering?
- roof clearing in february 2024 took 05:20 if you need to record that somewhere
- you should move the march 18 "schedule vacation days" event to happen before planting basil; if you move this forward, instead of noting that spreading compost is the first day off, just note that turning compost shouldn't require taking time off
- you should remove either the 04/04+04/05 plant basil event of the 02/18 plant basil event
- you could have a small greenhouse that you use for seedlings so that they can get established and not be interfered with by pests; you don't need to give the seedlings as much room since they would grow large enough to interfere with each other; you probably don't need to do this for the first planting of the year, but subsequent ones (like broccoli) might be good
- you didn't start watering basil until you planted everything; did that work?
- do you want to plant more basil in the garlic beds?
- you planted parsley one in each of the garden beds, you should probably update the schedule to say this
- you didn't start watering parsley until you planted everything; did that work?
- when scheduling vacation days, look at on-call schedule; what you did this year was postpone and garden activities that occur during primary until the first available day after primary; you took off secondaries regardless
