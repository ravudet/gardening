## 2025 garden

#### FOLLOW UPS FROM LAST YEAR
- You tried 5 rows of carrots in the square garden bed this year; how did that turn out?
- You put basil plants in with the black beans and carrots because something (maybe ants?) seem to be eating your seeds and hopefully the basil will deter them. Also note that you put a lot of bug spray down in those beds at the end of 2024, so maybe that was what really did it?
- Get airtight containers for freezing? Youâ€™ll want them to not leave too much unused freezer space, and to be easily swappable across freezers
- In 2024 (and a previous year) the broccoli seeds didn't sprout. You're trying doubling up on seeds this year. How did that go?





- you should prune trees the first saturday after you are done with mowing the grass and the first saturday before you start mowing the grass
- garlic curing ends 14 days after it starts
- you should add instructions for curing the garlic (clip 1 inch of stalk, store in a warm, dark, dry, well-ventilated location)
- you could have a small greenhouse that you use for seedlings so that they can get established and not be interfered with by pests; you don't need to give the seedlings as much room since they would grow large enough to interfere with each other; you probably don't need to do this for the first planting of the year, but subsequent ones (like broccoli) might be good
- you can use aluminum grilling tins to measure the water output of whatever sprinkler system you choose; would it make sense to have one 360 degree sprinkler in the middle of the garden? do you want a PVC "misting" system? you could make some of this easier by running a hose across the house to the garden
- put a metal (copper?) lining on the outside of each garden bed to prevent slugs? https://www.amazon.com/copper-tapes-conductive-electrical-tape/dp/B01I1XNY1E/
- next year, use compost in half of the beds and soil in the other half so that you can compare them
- add a day for incorporating learnings from that year
- add roof cleaning
- add last last and first mowing
