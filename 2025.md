## 2025 garden

#### FOLLOW UPS FROM LAST YEAR
- You tried 5 rows of carrots in the square garden bed this year; how did that turn out?
- You put basil plants in with the black beans and carrots because something (maybe ants?) seem to be eating your seeds and hopefully the basil will deter them. Also note that you put a lot of bug spray down in those beds at the end of 2024, so maybe that was what really did it?
- Get airtight containers for freezing? Youâ€™ll want them to not leave too much unused freezer space, and to be easily swappable across freezers
- In 2024 (and a previous year) the broccoli seeds didn't sprout. You're trying doubling up on seeds this year. How did that go?
- You added the tree and bush pruning before the first mow of the season. Did that work out? Do you also need to do it after the last mow of the season?
- Did the 2024 garlic do well? If not, it's probably because your curing didn't work well.
- You put copper lining around the garden beds. How did that work out? Do you really need to do that every year, or will it last from year to year?
- You did half your beds with compost and half with soil. Which did better?

#### NOTES FOR NEXT YEAR:
- i think it will make sense to do sundays next year instead of taking time off; and you will want to do "second to last sunday of march" to sift compost, "last sunday of march" to finish sifting compost" and "first sunday of april" to do the first major planting
- harvesting (you basically didn't do any of this this year):
    - put on ankle brace
    - get dressed
    - bring red phone
    - Use wired headphones in the morning so that you can call people in the afternoon
    - weigh bucket
    - take pictures of the plants
    - set up camera
    - harvest
    - Take picture of crop with red phone
    - Weigh crop
- planting:
    - mark bed with dimensions
    - dig trench
    - take pictures
    - count the number of seeds in a pack while planting
    - take pictures
- do you want to automate watering?
- roof clearing in february 2024 took 05:20 if you need to record that somewhere
- you should move the march 18 "schedule vacation days" event to happen before planting basil; if you move this forward, instead of noting that spreading compost is the first day off, just note that turning compost shouldn't require taking time off
- you should remove either the 04/04+04/05 plant basil event of the 02/18 plant basil event
- you could have a small greenhouse that you use for seedlings so that they can get established and not be interfered with by pests; you don't need to give the seedlings as much room since they would grow large enough to interfere with each other; you probably don't need to do this for the first planting of the year, but subsequent ones (like broccoli) might be good
- you didn't start watering basil until you planted everything; did that work?
- do you want to plant more basil in the garlic beds?
- you planted parsley one in each of the garden beds, you should probably update the schedule to say this
- you didn't start watering parsley until you planted everything; did that work?
- when scheduling vacation days, look at on-call schedule; what you did this year was postpone and garden activities that occur during primary until the first available day after primary; you took off secondaries regardless
- when scheduling vacation days, try to use a tighter fit based on how long each activity actually takes so that you can use fewer vacation days
- the first weeding of the season took a long time; maybe it makes more sense to start sooner in the year by a few weeks?
- you noticed when you were weeding for the first time, there were a decent number of small slugs hanging out under the "brush" (leaves, pine needle, etc) and also you noticed some grasshoppers or crickets or something; it might not be 100% slugs that are eating things
- you didn't turn compost on 03/29 like you were supposed to
- in 2024, you went to prep compost and realized it wasn't "done" yet. so you let it another year. it looks great this year. but the question is, in 2024, did the process of taking all of the compost out of the bin and then putting it back in facilitate it getting "done" for 2025? you haven't turned the 2026 compost this year, so next year, if the compost is not "done", you need to turn *next year's* compost each year
- i think turning the compost for the given year probably has no effect (maybe turning next year's has effect, noted above)
- compost sifting notes:
    - you used these tools:
        - pavers x22 (to stack to make a bench out of)
        - "counter top" to put across the pavers to lay sifting materials on
        - 5 gallon bucket x2 (to move compost from bin to working area)
        - shovel (to get compost out of bin and into buckets)
        - yard waste bin for uncomposted materials
        - chair
        - compost sifter
        - tub to put sifted compost into
        - gloves
        - safety glasses
        - extra bucket for worms to dump into next year's compost
        - trowel to remove non-worm critters and put them into the yard waste bin
    - your overall process (and it worked pretty well) was this: fill buckets with raw compost; take the buckets to the "station"; sift the buckets a bit at a time into the tub, removing worms as you discover them; once both buckets are empty, dump the tub into a garden bed; take the worms and the empty buckets back to the compost bin; dump the worms into next year's bin, and refill the buckets with raw compost
    - some stuff to maybe change next year:
        - you probably just want to skip your morning shower since you'll want to shower after doing this for a while
        - you had no problem getting started around 7:00am
        - it rained pretty consistently the first two days this year, so probably just be ready for that
        - you'll want to spread this across two days, preferably with some time between them
        - you didn't really get worn out mentally or physically, but you did start to feel it in your hand, forearm, and some back muscles by the end of the whole process
        - you ended up with holes in two different pairs of gloves by the end; they were well-used gloves, but regardless, it might make sense to just start with fresh gloves
- 04/05 planting notes:
    - you used these tools:
        - trowel
        - gloves
        - tape measure
        - sharpie
        - knife
        - scotch tape
    - the overall process was: mark the bed with ticks according to the planting dimensions, use the trowel to "slice" trenches, and place seeds into the intersections of the trenches
    - 3" is probably too small for the black beans
    - 3" is probably too small for the peas
    - 2" is definitely too small for the carrots
    - green beans should be 7" from edge every 9"
    - sharpies are not really working for you to do the marking; not sure what you should do instead, but you just destroy the sharpie and often can't see the mark it made
    - you need to add a note to the schedule that you should start watering again
    - you need to add a note to the schedule that you should start taking weekly pictures again (you used sunday this year and last year)
- do you want to put simple green on your roof going forward? i don't know the correct procedure to do this at the moment, and i'm not really getting rid of all of the moss each time i clean the roof so i don't know if i need to do that "properly" once before putting down the simple green

#### 04/01 began sifting compost

There was 38016 cubic inches of compost (6 "planks"). These were the garden beds before compost was applied:

![2025-04-01%20bed%2005.JPG](./images/2025-04-01%20bed%2005.JPG)

This was the "station" setup that you used for the sifting:

![2025-04-01%20sifting%20station%202.JPG](./images/2025-04-01%20sifting%20station%202.JPG)

Your overall process was to sift 2 buckets of compost at a time into the tub. Then you would dump the tub into a garden bed. You spent 07:20:48 sifting on this day.

#### 04/02 sifted more compost

You spent another 05:18:16 sifting on this day.

#### 04/04 finished sifting compost

You put 3.5 tubs of compost into bed 1:

![2025-04-04%20bed%2001.JPG](./images/2025-04-04%20bed%2001.JPG)

You put 6 tubs of compost into bed 2 (though you probably only needed 5):

![2025-04-04%20bed%2002.JPG](./images/2025-04-04%20bed%2002.JPG)

You put 7 tubs of compost into bed 3:

![2025-04-04%20bed%2003.JPG](./images/2025-04-04%20bed%2003.JPG)

You put 3 tubs of compost into bed 4:

![2025-04-04%20bed%2004.JPG](./images/2025-04-04%20bed%2004.JPG)

You put 3 tubs of compost into bed 5:

![2025-04-04%20bed%2005.JPG](./images/2025-04-04%20bed%2005.JPG)

This left you with 2 more tubs of compost that you put along the side of the house to fill some spotty locations.

You ultimately left 6336 cubic inches of compost in the bin (1 "plank"). You spent 03:34:59 sifting on this day.

#### 04/06 planted black beans, green beans, peas, and carrots
