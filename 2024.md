## 2024 garden

#### NOTES FOR NEXT YEAR:
- harvesting:
    - put on ankle brace
    - get dressed
    - Use wired headphones in the morning so that you can call people in the afternoon 
    - take pictures of the plants
    - set up camera
    - harvest
    - Take picture of crop
    - Weigh crop
- planting:
    - mark bed with dimensions
    - dig trench
    - take pictures
    - count the number of seeds in a pack while planting
    - take pictures
- you can probably add another row to the square bed carrots
- I think there’s ants or something eating your seeds in the front yard. Maybe you can plant basil and mint to address. Try to get them from a nursery and see if it works next year. Your carrots didn’t grow at all. If you use mint, use pots and don’t plant directly in the ground because it’ll take over. 
- Schedule all of your vacations days at the start
- Get airtight containers for freezing? You’ll want them to not leave too much unused freezer space, and to be easily swappable across freezers
- many of the broccoli seeds didn't sprout; this happened before; maybe you want to double up on the seeds?
- you should prune trees the first saturday after you are done with mowing the grass and the first saturday before you start mowing the grass
- garlic curing ends 14 days after it starts
- you should add instructions for curing the garlic (clip 1 inch of stalk, store in a warm, dark, dry, well-ventilated location)
