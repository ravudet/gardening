## 2026 garden

#### NOTES FOR NEXT YEAR:

- You didn't actually garden in 2025, largely as a result of the compost issue, so make sure to look at the 2025 "notes for next year" when going through these at the end of 2026
- do you want to create an "experimentation" bed? you'll probably want 2 so that you can alternate them; for example, you had the year where your compost ruined the beds completely, so a better approach would have been to "test" the compost in bed A this year, and then next year "fix" bed A, test something else in bed B, and make sure that bed A is actually "fixed"
- buy a 12" wall hook above the freezer chest so that you can hang our tresilles and the square watering rig in the off season; the measurements for where the hooks need to be are the exact same as the measurements for the rectangle watering rigs
- you should probably get your garden beds level; this will help maintain even watering, and i think this also might be why you lose so much soil each year
- do you want to use PVC cement for your watering rigs? you should use PVC primer (the purple stuff) before if you do
- buy timer and hoses and valves and splitters for the irrigation
