## 2026 garden

#### NOTES FOR NEXT YEAR:

- You didn't actually garden in 2025, largely as a result of the compost issue, so make sure to look at the 2025 "notes for next year" when going through these at the end of 2026
- do you want to create an "experimentation" bed? you'll probably want 2 so that you can alternate them; for example, you had the year where your compost ruined the beds completely, so a better approach would have been to "test" the compost in bed A this year, and then next year fix bed A, test something else in bed B, and make sure that bed A is actually "fixed"
